# Contributing
Feel welcome to contributing to this repository!

We rely on volunteers like you to expand our list of FAQs. You can always discuss possible contributions in the Discord
guild.

## Pull Request Process

1. Give your commit messages descriptive information about what you changed.
2. Submit a pull-request to the main repository and describe in short what you changed.

## Code changes
When contributing changes in code, make sure you tested your changes thoroughly. In your commits and pull requests,
describe the changes and state why you think your additions should be merged.

## FAQ changes
When contributing changes or additions to the FAQ list, make sure your writings are in British-English and use a
spell-checker. Furthermore, re-read your own writings and ask someone else to proofread it.

Refer to your sources of information where possible, preferably to [tweaked.cc](https://tweaked.cc) articles.

See the example faq (`faqs/example.md`) for more information and the possibilities of markdown.
